      <h2><a name="about">About Me</a></h2>
			
			<p>
      I am a software developer living in Houston, TX. Over the last 14 years
      I have worked with computers in one capacity or another. Most of that
      time was spent writing code.
      </p>
      
      <h2><a name="languages">Languages</a></h2>
			
      <p>
      Since January of 2006 I have been working with
      <a href="http://ruby-lang.org"><strong>Ruby</strong></a> and
      <a href="http://rubyonrails.com"><strong>Ruby on
      Rails</strong></a>. About a year ago (mid 2007) I started working on
      a large distributed system and began using <a href="http://erlang.org">
      <strong>Erlang</strong></a> extensively. By now many people have heard
      of Ruby and Rails, but Erlang is still relatively unknown. Which is a
      shame because Erlang is a great language and it allowed my team to build
      a complicated distributed system without many of the headaches that such
      systems usually entail. I love working with both Ruby and Erlang and I have
      found that they complement each other nicely.
      </p>

      <p>
      I find myself thinking in a functional mindset these days. This isn't
      a direct consequence of learning Erlang, I was interested in functional
      programming prior to that, but working with Erlang full time has given
      me an opportunity to really dig into the functional paradigm. I want
      to learn <a href="http://haskell.org/">Haskell</a>, but the Haskell syntax
      looks like line noise to me. I have also considered studying 
      <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ML_programming_language">
      ML</a> which features algebraic typing but looks a little less weird.
      </p>

      <p>
      Before all of that I worked with <strong>Java</strong> extensively and
      became a <strong>Sun Certified Java Professional</strong> in 2004. I think
      the Java community is great and there are some excellent Java tools out
      there, but I find the language itself to be lacking. Many of the "patterns"
      that float around the Java community are workarounds to mimic features that
      are missing from the language. I was constantly fighting against Java's
      shortcomings and that is what led me to Ruby, and later to Erlang.
      </p>

      <p>
      In the early years of my career I wrote mostly <strong>C++</strong>,
      transitioning to <strong>.NET</strong> when it became available and I had the
      opportunity. I still write <strong>C</strong> code from time to time, mostly when
      writing extensions for Ruby or Erlang. In and amongst all of that I have hacked
      some Javascript, Perl, Python and PHP when the need arose.
      </p>

      <p>
      I am comfortable with the mechanics of <strong>HTML</strong> and
      <strong>CSS</strong>. I can create a functional and attractive web application,
      but I am not a graphic designer by any stretch of the imagination. I have built
      many websites with Rails (and other technologies before that) and enjoy working
      in the medium.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="platforms">Platforms</a></h2>

      <p>
      I am a <strong>UNIX</strong> guy through and through. My current preference
      is to develop on <strong>Mac OS X</strong> and to deploy to <strong>Linux
      </strong>. Currently I use <strong>Ubuntu Linux</strong> for my personal sites
      and have used it professionally in the past. Ubuntu is my current favorite
      since it works well as a desktop and as a server. I have also used Debian,
      RedHat Enterprise Linux and Fedora Core when necessary.
      </p>

      <p>
      Way back in the day I used to run FreeBSD on my home server. It was
      fun, but Linux is more widespread and less work these days. The bigger
      community helps. My first big job out of college involved managing
      Solaris servers and when I was in college I used VMS and OSF/1.
      </p>

      <p>
      I was a die hard Windows user for a long time. Particularly after the
      release of Windows NT 4. Linux and FreeBSD were very poor on the desktop
      at that point and the classic Mac OS felt confining. Ultimately, the
      release of Mac OS X changed all of that...finally a robust UNIX OS
      with a usable desktop.
      </p>

      <h2><a name="tools">Tools</a></h2>

      <p>
      Every developer eventually develops a toolset that they fall back on.
      </p>

      <p>
      I currently use <a href="http://git-scm.com/"><strong>Git</strong></a>
      for version control. I have used <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">
      <strong>Subversion</strong></a> extensively in the past, but I like the
      flexibility that a distributed version control system brings. I host public
      Git repositories on <a href="https://github.com/"><strong>Github</strong></a>
      and I use <a href="http://gitx.frim.nl/"><strong>GitX</strong></a> on OS X.
      </p>

      <p>
      For coding I use <a href="http://macromates.com/"><strong>TextMate</strong></a>
      most of the time, but occasionally I will fire up
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/"><strong>Emacs</strong></a>
      when I think I need something more powerful. I always end up going back to 
      TextMate. I don't feel the need to use an IDE anymore, but when I was doing
      a lot of Java programming, I was a big fan of <a href="http://eclipse.org/">
      <strong>Eclipse</strong></a>.
      </p>


      <h2><a name="projects">Projects</a></h2>

      <p>
      The best way to judge a programmer is certainly to look at his code. I
      have a number of public repositories available on

      During 2006 and 2007 I organized "Lunch and Learn" sessions at my company.
      I gave talks at a few of these sessions, the slides for two of these talks
      are available at SlideShare.

      <p>			
      I learned a while ago that you have to get out from behind the keyboard
      every now and then. I enjoy brewing beer and make a pretty good Scottish
      heavy. I have also been known to brew mead and cider when I want to do
      something different. I don't brew as often as I would like, usually 3 or
      4 times a year.
      </p>

      <p>
      I have been a history buff since I was a teenager and I enjoy historical
      documentaries and books. I am less interested in modern history and tend
      to focus more on the middle ages and earlier. I also love good sci-fi books
      and movies. Everything from grand space operas to movies with giant robots
      and big explosions. But then, who doesn't love giant robots and big explosions?
      </p>

      <p>
      Speaking of big explosions, the one hobby that seems to take up the most time
      is gaming. I own both an XBox 360 and an Playstation 3, although the PS3 is a
      recent acquisition intended mainly for watching BluRay movies.
